This code was written as part of my introduction to full-blockchain-solidity-course-js from @PatrickAlphaC

Here we learned how to use the library for any type in a smart contract, we learned about arrays, constuctors, mapping and modifiers.  We also learned about ways to send native coins (transfer, send, call). 
To top it all off: I learned about receive(), fallback(), constant and immutable, I learned the basic principles of saving gas.
  
This smart contract is a kind of fund where people can vnostoyat eth to the address of the contract. We also get eth price via Chainlink oracles and allow users to contribute a minimum of 50usd $ETH. The owner can also call a function to return all their eth.

This repository signals that I have taken a basic course on Solidity from Patrick Collins.
